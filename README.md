# CSPB_1300
For this C++ final project, you will create an image processing application that implements some of the functions we saw in that activity. That may sound complicated, but don't panic! Most of the algorithms you need are already provided to you in the Runestone book so your main job is going to be translating Python to C++ code, creating a simple user interface, and putting the pieces together to form a complete working image processing application.

The high-level summary of what you will be doing in this project is as follows:
-Implement the 10 image processing functions
-Implement a simple user interface for your application
