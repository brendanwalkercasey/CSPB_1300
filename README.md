# CSPB 1300 - Dr.Jones - Computer Science I: Starting Computing
### CU Boulder's Applied Computer Science Program
For this C++ final project, you will create an image processing application that implements some of the functions we saw in that activity. That may sound complicated, but don't panic! Most of the algorithms you need are already provided to you in the Runestone book so your main job is going to be translating Python to C++ code, creating a simple user interface, and putting the pieces together to form a complete working image processing application.

The high-level summary of what you will be doing in this project is as follows:
1) Implement the 10 image processing functions
2) Implement a simple user interface for your application


For each of the image processing functions, you will be:
1) taking in the original image as a parameter
2) creating and initializing a new 2-dimensional vector to store the new image data,
3) iterating through the original image,
4) performing the requested image processing operation on the pixel values,
5) saving the modified pixel values to the new vector,
6) returning the new vector
